### 🧠 Who am I?

I'm a 17-year-old student from Pakistan, diving deep into **programming**, **cybersecurity**, and **content creation**.  
When I’m not studying Biology or prepping for the MDCAT, I’m building real-world projects, writing code that (mostly) works, and sharing insights on LinkedIn and YouTube.

---

### 💻 What I Do

- Build full-stack apps — especially using **React** and **Next.js**
- Explore cybersecurity — focusing on ethical hacking, automation, and scripting
- Create content — short-form tech & productivity insights
- Learn fast, break things (intentionally), and ship even faster

---

### 🛠️ Tech I Work With

- **Languages:** JavaScript (confident), Python (confident), HTML & CSS (solid foundation)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js (intermediate)
- **Deployment & Backend:** Vercel, Firebase (solid), Supabase (used it, not a fan for migrations)
- **Other Tools:** Git & GitHub, Bash, APIs, VS Code, Kali Linux (basic)
